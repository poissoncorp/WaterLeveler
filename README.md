# WaterLeveler

Water Leveler is a solution for to ACM2001F [Problem](http://cepc.mimuw.edu.pl/2001/problems/f.pdf)
- I've created an algotithm which solves the problem in object-oriented way
- I've extended the Cisterns shapes possibilities by Cone,Cylinder and Sphere shaped water tanks
- Everything has been visualized using Unity 3D Engine
- I can't publish entire Unity project so i've put the code into the Unity-Not-Compiled-Code folder 

## Development
- Create SQL Database containing Cisterns data
- Use Entity Framework ORM to communicate between program and database
- Create web application using ASP.NET
- Create nice looking frontend with React
- Idea - pushing an "add" button on website makes the new Cistern in Unity appear with recalculation of water level
